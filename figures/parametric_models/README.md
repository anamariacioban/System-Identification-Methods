# Parametric Model Identification and Validation Figures

This folder contains figures related to the identification, calibration, and
validation of parametric models used in the system identification process.

The figures illustrate the modeling workflow starting from the initial model
structure, parameter calibration, and final validation on independent data sets.

## Description

The figures included in this folder cover the following aspects:

- Initial model structure and symbolic representation
- Model modifications performed during the calibration stage
- Calibration results using dedicated excitation signals
- Validation of the identified models on a separate data set (S2)
- Residual analysis and performance evaluation
- Comparison between different parametric models (ARX, ARMAX, OE / State-Space)

These figures highlight the differences in model accuracy, robustness, and
generalization capability across the considered parametric modeling approaches.
