# Model Comparison Figures

This folder contains figures used to compare the performance of the identified
models obtained using different identification methods.

The comparison focuses on evaluating each model using data generated by
different excitation signals.

## Description

The figures illustrate the following cases:

- Model identified using Chirp excitation, evaluated on Chirp data  
- Model identified using Chirp excitation, evaluated on step-response (linear regression) data  

These comparisons highlight the robustness and generalization capability of the
identified models when applied to data different from the one used during
identification.
