# Model Comparison Figures

The figures illustrate the following cases:

Model identified using Chirp excitation, evaluated on Chirp experimental data

Model identified using Chirp excitation, evaluated on step-response (linear regression) experimental data

Model identified using step-response (linear regression) data, evaluated on Chirp experimental data

Model identified using step-response (linear regression) data, evaluated on step-response experimental data

These comparisons highlight the robustness and generalization capability of the
identified models when applied to experimental data different from the one used
during the identification process.
